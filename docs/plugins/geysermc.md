### What does the plugin do?

GeyserMC enables clients from Minecraft Bedrock Edition to join your Minecraft Java server.

## Usage

:::important
GeyserMC requires your server to be on the latest version. 
:::

[Download the plugin](https://ci.nukkitx.com/job/GeyserMC/job/Geyser/job/master/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/bootstrap/spigot/target/Geyser-Spigot.jar), and upload the jar into your `plugins` folder, and then restart the server. If you need help installing plugins, check [How to install plugins](https://docs.bloom.host/plugins). 

Once you've installed it, make a ticket in our [discord](https://discord.com/invite/2QxW8QY), and request a 19132 port for bedrock. 

After that, just restart the server, and bedrock players should then be able to connect to your java server.
