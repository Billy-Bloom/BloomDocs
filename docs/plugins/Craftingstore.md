## What is CraftingStore?

Crafting store is an automatic Minecraft donation store page where you can create your own webpage and sell things like keys and ranks to your players.  

## Usage
To install, go and download the latest version [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/craftingstore-net-free-minecraft-donation-system-1-16-compatible.31331/) then move the file to your `plugins` folder. Turn on or restart the server. Once you have done that, create an account at [https://craftingstore.net/register](https://craftingstore.net/register).  
Use the Server Setup tool to setup your server how you want it.

Now, get the API key from the servers page and enter it in the plugin config. Restart one last time, and you can now start accepting donations!
