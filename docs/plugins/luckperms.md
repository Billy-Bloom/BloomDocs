# Luckperms

### What does the plugin do?
Luckperms is a permission plugin built for Minecraft servers to handle permissions from all your plugins. It is considered to be one of the best permission plugins due to it's accessibility and how it handles data.

Unlike PermissionsEx, Luckperms stores in either MySQL or .db (database), which makes it much faster than a yml file that PermissionsEx uses.

## Usage

To use this plugin, download the jar you need it for. Most commonly, for single servers, it would be the Bukkit jar. 

Upload the jar into your `/plugins folder`. Restart the server. If you need help installing plugins, check [How to install plugins](https://docs.bloom.host/plugins).

To begin, simply do `/lp editor`. Once you have made your edits, click save and paste the link it gives you. If you need more help, consult with the [Luckperms wiki](https://luckperms.net/wiki/Home)
