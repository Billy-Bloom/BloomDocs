# **Dynmap**

## What does the plugin do?
Dynmap allows you to see your Minecraft world in 3D in real time, like Google Maps.

# Usage
Download the Dynmap plugin and place into the `plugins` folder then restart your server to generate `configuration.txt`. Create a MySQL database. If you are unsure, [check out this guide](https://docs.bloom.host/databases).  

Now enter the database information into this section remembering to remove the `#`
(Note: Don't enter the information below enter the information from your MySQL database)  

```YAML
    storage:
    type: mysql
     hostname: 123.456.67.2
     port: 3306
     database: s123_dynmap
     userid: u12323402
     password:  123456789
```
Now go into the Bloom.host discord, click the "Ports" tab, and create a new port. This port is randomly generated, so you will have to change the port in the config file.  

You can also request your Dynmap IP to be added to Bloom's reverse proxy, changing the website link from `123.456.67.2:8123` to `subdomain.yourdomain.com`. Please read [this guide](https://docs.bloom.host/reverse-proxy).
