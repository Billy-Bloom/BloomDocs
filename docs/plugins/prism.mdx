# Prism
## Info
[Spigot Page](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/prism.75166/)

[Jenkins](https://jenkins.addstar.com.au/job/Prism-Bukkit%201.16/)

[Wiki](https://github.com/AddstarMC/Prism-Bukkit/wiki)

### What does the plugin do?

It is highly configurable, and is a powerful, high performance grief management (rollbacks, restores, etc) plugin for your server.

## Usage

:::important
Before you get started, you need to have created a MySQL database. More info on that can be found [here](https://docs.bloom.host/databases).
:::


[Download the plugin](https://jenkins.addstar.com.au/job/Prism-Bukkit%201.16/), and upload the jar into your `/plugins folder`, and then restart the server. If you need help installing plugins, check [How to install plugins](https://docs.bloom.host/plugins). 
 
 After that, go to the `Prism` folder, which can be found inside the `plugins` folder. From there, edit the `config.yml` file. 

Go down to the `mysql` section, and enter your database details, and also change  `useNonStandardSql: true` to `useNonStandardSql: false`

:::caution
Do not copy the configuration below exactly, your login details for your own database will be different. 
:::

```YML
  mysql:
    hostname: 135.181.0.179
    username: u398_a63h3x4IdH
    password: 'BMMQhZ@2oCt4PYDs02LS^1^m'
    databaseName: s398_minecraft
    prefix: prism_
    port: '3306'
    useNonStandardSql: false
```
 Once you've done that, you need to restart the server in order for changes to take affect.
