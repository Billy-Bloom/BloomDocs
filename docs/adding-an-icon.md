After clicking you should then get an option saying “download png” click on this and save the file as “server-icon.png”. 

Now go to your server and open “file management” then open “file explorer” in the dropdown menu.

Click upload and pick the icon you made, make sure you name the file exactly server-icon.png or this will not work.
