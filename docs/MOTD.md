# **How to change your MOTD**

## How to change your MOTD without a plugin

First you need to write your MOTD, you can use [this website](https://mctools.org/motd-creator) to help you. Once  you have your MOTD like you want it, copy the `server.properties` code, like the one shown below
![server.properties](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/716405933105872938/751221395622723715/unknown.png)
Open your server panel and head to File Explorer, if you need a hand, check out [this guide!](https://docs.bloom.host/file-manager-controls). Now, enter your `server.properties` and head to the motd section and paste the copied text where the old one was, then restart your server and your changes will be made.

## How to change your MOTD with ServerListPlus
ServerListPlus is a plugin that changes your MOTD through a plugin also adding features like custom MOTDs for seperate players. You can download it [here!](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/serverlistplus.241/)

## How to change your MOTD on Bungeecord
Changing your MOTD on Bungeecord is slightly different. You can still use ServerListPlus, following the guide above, but if you want to do it without ServerListPlus, enter your Bungeecord `config.yml` and head to the MOTD
