### Blue Area
The blue area shows where exactly you are in the files. So if you were to go into your plugins folder, it would change to /home/container/plugins
### Red Area
The red area is "The Bar". You can make new files, new folders, upload files, or use a mass action on several selected files or folders. 
### Orange Area
The orange area is your directory. This is the place where all your files are in. To open a file or folder, right click on it. To modify it, left click on it.
### Left Click // Actions Area
When you left click on a file or folder, you have several options on what to do with it, ranging from renaming to deleting it.
