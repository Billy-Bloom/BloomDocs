# Basic Controls

Hey Bloomers! ðŸ‘‹

This guide will help you understand your panel environment and what everything means.

You can access your server's main control panel [here](https://mc.bloom.host/)! - If you have several servers, you will have to select the one you wish to modify.

### **Here is an example of the main page!**

### **On top of the panel you can view live information about your server!**
- Here you can see your server's public IP address which is used to connect to your server (Purple) and your server's ID which is crucial when reciving support! (Blue)
- Green is your memory the memory usage your server is using. With Aikar's flags, you will be using most of this. Unused memory is wasted memory!
- Orange is the CPU usage of your two cores. Minecraft Paper will only utilize 2 cores, meaning, having more doesnâ€™t mean better performance. If you wish to have more, consider getting a VPS.
- Red is the disk space that you have used. Plugins that store a lot of data such as Dynmap may take up lots of storage, so itâ€™s recommended to keep an eye on the amount of storage you have left. If you reach the maximum amount of storage, your server will shut down and wait until you have enough storage to restart again.

### **Below you can view the console area.**
In here, you can send any command and see what everyone on your server is doing. When launching a command, remember to remove the `/`. If you still want to use a `/`, consider using [this](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/81157) plugin!

### **Right below your console you can see the server control menu!**
This allows you to start, stop, and restart your server. It is not recommended to kill your server as plugins and worlds wonâ€™t save and may become corrupted. Only use it if your server becomes unresponsive.

### **Lastly, you can see view the server's live RAM and CPU usage in a form of graphs!** 
As mentioned above, with Aikar's flags, it will show up as if you were using most of this.
