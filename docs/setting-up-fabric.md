# Setting Up Fabric
Hey there Bloomers! ðŸ‘‹

In this guide, we will go over how to install Fabric and set up Fabric mods on your Minecraft server.

## Installing Fabric
Go to [fabricmc.net](https://fabricmc.net/use/?page=server) and download the installer.  
Run the Fabric Installer jar you downloaded, select the Server tab and select the Minecraft Version you want. 

**NOTE** You need to click **show snapshots** if you want it to also show fabric for minecraft snapshots.

Click install, this will download a *fabric-server-launch.jar*, it will also show you a button for *Download server jar*, press that one too.

You can now close the fabric launcher, you should have a *fabric-server-launch.jar* and a *server.jar* file.  
Upload those files to the root of your bloom server.  
Go to the Startup tab of the bloom panel and set **Server Jar File** to *fabric-server-launch.jar*  
Restart your server and let the files generate. This may take a few minutes. 

You are now done, you are running a fabric server!  
It's a server without mods though, so it's still purely vanilla at this point, keep reading to learn how to install mods.
